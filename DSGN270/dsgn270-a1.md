# `MythicTrap.com` Critque

## Usability

Right off the bat this website has a mission statement letting you know it's a resource for World of Warcraft strategy. It also gives you clear examples of how the pages will be laid out when selecting which *dungeon* or *boss* you're going to be referencing.

The light text really pops against the dark background giving it a fantastic contrast ratio and also uses the nice clean sans-serif font **Roboto**. 
Font scale is well implemented, the text is easily readable with body and headings being clearly differentiated.

This website follows several web conventions such as:
- Navigation at the top of the screen
- Hero footer as a site map
- Clickable logo that returns to homepage

All in all the website feels very intuitive and is easy to navigate.

## Visual Hierarchy

This website features a few good examples of visual hierarchy:
- Alignment
- Colour and Contrast
- Negative Space
- Proximity
- Size and Scale 

The content is well aligned. As I mentioned earlier once you've selected a specific boss or dungeon the content is sorted chronologically as you scroll down. They've also chosen to alternate which side they put their text boxes so they don't clutter one side of your screen.

The developers opted to use black and dark greys for the backgrounds. The text is white and there is also a shade of yellow to highlight important text. When using the accessibility inspector the text is rated at a 20 for contrast ratio.

Negative Space is apparent on all pages with nice open spaces between content. This draws your eyes to what's important because there is nothing else to look at. The reduced clutter is pleasant on the eyes, the elements are allowed to breathe if you will.

Good use of proximity is displayed with descriptive text near the gifs. Text boxes are positioned under or beside the images giving more details about the specific mechanic being displayed. Icons in the text box are also hoverable to display a more detailed tooltip with more info on the ability being highlighted.

Size and scale is also used well with text bolded and scaled up for important information. The websites uses headings well in its subsections, with obvious titles that standout.

## Mobile Friendliness

This website has a great responsive design. It loads up very quickly despite having high quality gifs. The content scales great on mobile collapsing the horizontal card layout from the desktop version to vertical cards on mobile. 

The navigation spans the top on the desktop version whereas the mobile version features a collapsible navigation denoted by the usual 3 horizontal lined icon in the top right.

Everything works just as well on a touch screen as it does with a mouse and keyboard. Although most users play the game on a PC and would use this on another monitor if they don't have that luxury they can easily use their phone.

## Content Quality

The content contained here is top notch. This website's layout makes the information much more digestible than many of the most popular **WoW** guides/strategy websites. For example this [IcyVeins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shriekwing-strategy-guide-for-castle-nathria) guide to *Shriekwing* is much more text based and uses static images, it doesn't look as nice as the [MythicTrap](https://mythictrap.com/castleNathria/shriekwing) one.

Each boss in the Raid section has a selector for which difficulty you're playing at, adding or removing information on mechanics that are present depending on what you selected. Then as you scroll you're introduced to each mechanic in a chronological order as they'd appear when you fight the boss.

The website also features a selector for which role you are playing:

### Tank
>The tank's primary role is to absorb damage and prevent others from being attacked.[1]
### Healer
>The healer' primary role purpose is to heal friendly characters or give them defensive buffs.[2]
### DPS
>Damage dealers are players who are responsible for dealing damage in the group. Usually abbreviated as DPS (Damage per second)[3]

When selecting your role the strategy will then be modified to give you specific instructions based on your role.

On top of all the gifs and text based instruction they include an external link, at the bottom, to a video guide if you prefer.

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since 2004 and this is by far the best designed site related to WoW I've ever seen.

          <strong>Confectionery</strong> is the art of making
          <strong>confections</strong>, which are food items that are rich in
          sugar and carbohydrates. Exact definitions are difficult. In general,
          though, confectionery is divided into two broad and somewhat
          overlapping categories, <strong>bakers' confections</strong> and
          <strong>sugar confections.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Bakers' confectionery, also called flour confections, includes
          principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sugar confectionery includes candies (also called sweets in many
          English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum,
          bubble gum, pastillage, and other confections that are made primarily
          of sugar. In some cases,
          <strong>chocolate confections</strong> (confections made of chocolate)
          are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of
          sugar confections. The words candy (Canada & US), sweets (UK, Ireland
          and others), and lollies (Australia and New Zealand) are common words
          for the most common varieties of sugar confectionery.
        </p>

        <p>
          The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools
          and extensive historical records. Traditional confectionery goes back
          to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the Middle Ages
          into the modern era.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr />
      <section>
        <p>
          Before sugar was readily available in the ancient western world,
          confectionery was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China,
          Ancient India, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome to coat
          fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create sweetmeats. Between
          the 6th and 4th centuries BC, the Persians, followed by the Greeks,
          made contact with the Indian subcontinent and its "reeds that produce
          honey without bees". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane
          agriculture. Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical Indian subcontinent
          and Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early history of sugar usage in Europe, it was initially the
          apothecary who had the most important role in the production of
          sugar-based preparations. Medieval European physicians learned the
          medicinal uses of the material from the Arabs and Byzantine Greeks.
          One Middle Eastern remedy for rheums and fevers were little, twisted
          sticks of pulled sugar called in Arabic al f채n채d or al p채n채d. These
          became known in England as alphenics, or more commonly as penidia,
          penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the precursors of barley sugar
          and modern cough drops. In 1390, the Earl of Derby paid "two shillings
          for two pounds of penydes."
        </p>
        <p>
          As the non-medicinal applications of sugar developed, the comfitmaker,
          or confectioner gradually came into being as a separate trade. In the
          late medieval period the words confyt, comfect or cumfitt were generic
          terms for all kinds of sweetmeats made from fruits, roots, or flowers
          preserved with sugar. By the 16th century, a cumfit was more
          specifically a seed, nut or small piece of spice enclosed in a round
          or ovoid mass of sugar. The production of comfits was a core skill of
          the early confectioner, who was known more commonly in 16th and 17th
          century England as a comfitmaker. Reflecting their original medicinal
          purpose, however, comfits were also produced by apothecaries and
          directions on how to make them appear in dispensatories as well as
          cookery texts. An early medieval Latin name for an apothecary was
          <em>confectionarius</em>, and it was in this sort of sugar work that
          the activities of the two trades overlapped and that the word
          "confectionery" originated.

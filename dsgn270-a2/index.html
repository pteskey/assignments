    <h1>Confectionery</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          <strong>Confectionery</strong> is the art of making
          <strong>confections</strong>, which are food items that are rich in
          sugar and carbohydrates. Exact definitions are difficult. In
          general, though, confectionery is divided into two broad and
          somewhat overlapping categories,
          <strong>bakers' confections</strong> and
          <strong>sugar confections.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Bakers' confectionery, also called flour confections, includes
          principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sugar confectionery includes candies (also called sweets in many
          English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum,
          bubble gum, pastillage, and other confections that are made
          primarily of sugar. In some cases,
          <strong>chocolate confections</strong> (confections made of
          chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free
          versions of sugar confections. The words <em>candy</em> (Canada &
          US), <em>sweets</em> (UK, Ireland and others), and
          <em>lollies</em> (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for
          the most common varieties of sugar confectionery.
        </p>

        <p>
          The confectionery industry also includes specialized training
          schools and extensive historical records. Traditional confectionery
          goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the
          Middle Ages into the modern era.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr />

        <p>
          Before sugar was readily available in the ancient western world,
          confectionery was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China,
          Ancient India, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome to
          coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create sweetmeats.
          Between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, the Persians, followed by the
          Greeks, made contact with the Indian subcontinent and its "reeds
          that produce honey without bees". They adopted and then spread sugar
          and sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical
          Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early history of sugar usage in Europe, it was initially the
          apothecary who had the most important role in the production of
          sugar-based preparations. Medieval European physicians learned the
          medicinal uses of the material from the Arabs and Byzantine Greeks.
          One Middle Eastern remedy for rheums and fevers were little, twisted
          sticks of pulled sugar called in Arabic <em>al f채n채d</em> or
          <em>al p채n채d</em>. These became known in England as alphenics, or
          more commonly as penidia, penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the
          precursors of barley sugar and modern cough drops. In 1390, the Earl
          of Derby paid "two shillings for two pounds of penydes."
        </p>
        <p>
          As the non-medicinal applications of sugar developed, the
          comfitmaker, or confectioner gradually came into being as a separate
          trade. In the late medieval period the words confyt, comfect or
          cumfitt were generic terms for all kinds of sweetmeats made from
          fruits, roots, or flowers preserved with sugar. By the 16th century,
          a cumfit was more specifically a seed, nut or small piece of spice
          enclosed in a round or ovoid mass of sugar. The production of
          comfits was a core skill of the early confectioner, who was known
          more commonly in 16th and 17th century England as a comfitmaker.
          Reflecting their original medicinal purpose, however, comfits were
          also produced by apothecaries and directions on how to make them
          appear in dispensatories as well as cookery texts. An early medieval
          Latin name for an apothecary was
          <em>confectionarius</em>, and it was in this sort of sugar work that
          the activities of the two trades overlapped and that the word
          "confectionery" originated.
